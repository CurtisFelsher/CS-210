This was a project to design a banking application for users to learn the concepts of fiscal resposibility.

I believe I did the project particullarly well in its design and omission of uneccessary code. 

I believe I could enhance my code by making the main even smaller and moving most of the functions out of main.

The hardest time I had with the project was getting the catch to work to validate use input. It mainly due to syntax errors and I did get it to work in the end to my liking.

This is the project where I worked with multiple menus leading to other outputs and I really enjoyed it. It helped me in the final project in designing a nicer menu system that declutters the screen when an option os chosen.

I kept the code simple and readable. The various menus sohuld be easily modifed as they are outside of main and only variable names would need to be modified. This could be even better if I were to pull evyerthing out of main like I did in my final project.
